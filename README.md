# A-vision-based-reinforcement-learning-agent-trained-with-PPO
Building in public: A vision-based reinforcement learning agent trained with PPO that learns to navigate a dynamic environment directly from pixel observations. This project explores a modular robot-brain-style pipeline—perception, decision-making, and action—implemented and tested in simulation.
